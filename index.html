          <p>
            Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., Jacques
            finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy
            tail.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he doesn’t have classic
            lycanthropy. Turning into a squirrel does cause fewer problems than
            turning into a wolf. Instead of having to worry about accidentally
            eating the neighbor (that would be awkward), he worries about being
            eaten by the neighbor’s cat. After two occasions where he woke up on
            a precariously thin branch in the crown of an oak, naked and
            disoriented, he has taken to locking the doors and windows of his
            room at night and putting a few walnuts on the floor to keep himself
            busy.
          </p>
          <p>
            That takes care of the cat and tree problems. But Jacques would
            prefer to get rid of his condition entirely. The irregular
            occurrences of the transformation make him suspect that they might
            be triggered by something. For a while, he believed that it happened
            only on days when he had been near oak trees. But avoiding oak trees
            did not stop the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Switching to a more scientific approach, Jacques has started keeping
            a daily log of everything he does on a given day and whether he
            changed form. With this data he hopes to narrow down the conditions
            that trigger the transformations.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the set of data2 determine which events are more and less
            correlated with the transformation of Jacques. Specifically, use the
            Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)3 to determine the correlation
            between the events. The MCC is defined as follows: $$MCC = {TP
            \times TN - FP \times FN \over \sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN
            + FN)}}.$$
          </p>
          <p>
            A sample of the confusion matrix is presented above. The matrix
            provides the relation between the conversion into a squirrel and
            eating pizza.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            The values for TP (true positives), TN (true negatives), FP (false
            positives), and FN (false negatives) are the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>true positives (TP) = 1</li>
            <li>true negatives (TN) =76</li>
            <li>false positives (FP) = 4</li>
            <li>and false negatives (FN) = 9</li>
